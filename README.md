This application consists of five games that test various mathematical and logical skills. The games are launched from the command line using the corresponding commands.

To install the application, clone the repository, navigate to the application directory, and install the dependencies using git and pip commands.

Game Descriptions
Even Check (brain-even): In this game, a random number is shown to the user. The user needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

Calculator (brain-calc): A random mathematical expression is shown to the user, who needs to calculate and enter the correct answer.

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) (brain-gcd): Two random numbers are shown to the user, who must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

Arithmetic Progression (brain-progression): A series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression is shown to the user, with one number replaced by two dots. The player must determine this number. The position of the hidden element changes randomly each time.

Is it a Prime Number? (brain-prime): A number is shown to the user, who needs to determine if it is a prime number by answering yes or no.
